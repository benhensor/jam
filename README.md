# Jam - A Spotify Playlist Generator

In this project, the task was to build a React web application called Jam. This challenge tests my knowledge of React components, passing state, and ability to work with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

* React
* Styled Components
* Axios
* Spotify Web API

### Backend:

* Express JS
* axios
* cors
* dotenv
* cookie-parser
* nodemon

## Features

* Users can sign into their Spotify accounts.
* Users can search for artists, albums or songs.
* Results can filtered by artist, album or song.
* Users can click on search results to trigger further searches (IE clicking an album title will search for that album etc).
* Users can show or hide the playlist.
* Tracks can be added and removed from the playlist.
* The playlist can be renamed by clicking on the title.
* A playlist containing at least one track can be exported and saved to the users spotify account.
* Fully repsosive design across all screen sizes.
* Use of context hooks for state management throughout.

## Future Work

* I am very happy with the project in it's current state. To improve it I would add additional functionality to show artist/album/song specific information and enhanced searching capabilities. 
* I would also expand on the user controls area incorporating more detail into the users information and implementing the ability to preview/play tracks. 
* There are also a number of frustrating style issues to iron out, especially on mobile devices.
